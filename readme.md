# Ongoing fixes for `Razer Synapse Service Process.exe`

## Installation

> Note: It is a good idea to make a backup of any directory or files before overwriting.

1. Download the appropriate [release](https://github.com/tasadar2/Razer-Razer-Synapse-Service-Process/releases)
1. Shutdown the windows service `Razer Synapse Service`
1. Extract the downloaded files to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Razer\Synapse3\UserProcess`, overwriting what is there

## Fixes

- Greatly reduced the hardcoded delay when auto-switching between profiles based on focused window
